Binary Search AlgorithmTable of ContentsOverviewHow Binary Search WorksCode ImplementationTime ComplexityUse CasesContributingLicenseOverviewBinary Search is a highly efficient search algorithm that works on sorted arrays. It follows a divide-and-conquer approach to find the target element by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.How Binary Search WorksStep 1: Start by checking the middle element of the array.Step 2: Compare the target value with the middle element:If the middle element matches the target, you've found the value.If the target is smaller than the middle element, repeat the process with the left half of the array.If the target is larger than the middle element, repeat the process with the right half of the array.Step 3: Repeat this process until the target is found or the subarray becomes empty.
